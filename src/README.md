# Code and Models

This folder is intended to store the source code of the project. It should include all of the code needed to reproduce model results when paired with the relevant data.
This readme documents the provenance and information pertinent to the code stored in this folder, as well as instructions for how a new user or collaborator can set up and run this code. 

*NB: We have included template requirements.txt and tests.py files as suggestions for a python based project, and example instructions for a pip install of these requirements.
If these are not relevant to your project please delete them from your repository, and this line of text.*

## Code Considerations


- Commercialisation potential (need to keep code confidential if so etc.)
- Storage (github?)
- Collaboration guidelines
- Model provenance (need to document)
- Audit trail (ensure logging and naming conventions for versioning, storing model results?)
- End user consideration (who are you building this for?)

- code for cleaning
- code for testing


## Requirements
What are the requirements and how to install?

E.g. 
(include generic example requirements and how to install those with pip here?)


## Running this code

Instructions for how to set up and run this code!
These should be detailed enough that a new collaborator or user can read the instructions and succeed at running your models without the need to reach out for additional help.
